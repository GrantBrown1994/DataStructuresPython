# DataStructuresPython
My personal implimentation of different Data Structures in Python <br />
  The Data Structures that have been created so far are: <br />
    1) Stacks <br />
    2) Queues <br />
    3) Deques <br />
    4) Linked Lists <br />
    5) Linked Stacks <br />
    6) Circularly Linked Lists <br />
    7) Queues with CircularlyLinkedLists <br />
    8) Doubly Linked Lists <br />
    9) Positional List <br />
    10) Doubly Linked Positional List <br />
    11) General Trees <br />
    12) Binary Trees <br />
    13) Linked Binary Trees <br />
    14) Maps <br />
    15) Hash Tables <br />
    16) Seperate Chain Hash Tables <br />
    17) Linear Probe Hash Tables <br />
    <br />
  The Sorting and Search Algorithms that have been created so far: <br />
    1) Binary Search <br />
    2) Insertion Sort <br />
    3) Preorder Transversal <br />
    4) Postorder Transversal <br />
    5) Breadth-First Transversal <br />
    6) Inorder Transversal <br />
   
   
  For explanation on implementation of data structures refer to comments in code as they should give a detailed analysis of <br />
  the data strucutres and algorithms implemented. <br />
